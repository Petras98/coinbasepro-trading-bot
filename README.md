# coinbasepro-trading-bot
A simple bot to automate trades on coinbase pro. The first bot is just a simplified grid bot with a max and min.

There is also a grid bot implementation that allows you to specify how many grids you want and your budget. It currently has small bug that causes an "Insufficient Funds" error from the coinbase pro api causing the bot to shutdown.

Note: this is just a personal project for fun. Use with real funds at your own risk and with sufficient testing.
